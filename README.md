# SLEGO: A Collaborative Data Analytics System

## Overview

**SLEGO (Software-Lego)** is a cloud-based collaborative analytics platform designed by NG Siu Lung, a PhD student at UNSW's Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department and the FAIC Research Center. The platform bridges the gap between experienced developers and novice users by leveraging modular, reusable microservices and a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the creation of comprehensive analytics pipelines without requiring programming skills.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the paper: [SLEGO: A Collaborative Data Analytics System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11232).

## Features

- **Modular Microservices:** Easily share and integrate analytical tools and workflows.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Create analytics pipelines through a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **LLM-Powered Recommendations:** Enhance microservice selection and integration with a knowledge base and recommendation system.
- **Collaborative Environment:** Promote resource reusability and team collaboration.

## Use Cases
